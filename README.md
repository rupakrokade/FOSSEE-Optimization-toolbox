# FOSSEE Optimization Toolbox for Scilab 6.0.x

A toolbox that provides mixed-integer programming, quadratic programming and nonlinear programming tools in Scilab through various open-source libraries available from Coin-OR.

NOTE: On linux systems with gfortran8 as the default version, the user will need to install libgfortran4 for the toolbox to load. This can be done, for example in Ubuntu, by executing: sudo apt-get install libgfortran4


## To Download
1. [Visit the link
   `http://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/FOT/`]
2. Select the linux or windows version as per your platform.
3. Extract the files.

## To use
1. In Scilab, change the working directory to the root directory of the repository
2. Run `exec loader.sce` in the scilab console.
3. The Toolbox is now ready, to see help type `help FOSSEE Optimization Toolbox` in console.
4. The demos are available in `Demos folder`.
5. To run a demo type `exec <name of function>.dem.sce`
6. Test cases are available in `tests folder`.

## To build
1. If you have updated the source code, you need to build it again to see the changes.
2. To build it first unlink the toolbox by executing the command `ulink`.
3. Then type `exec builder.sce` to run the builder. {Prerequisites: In windows you need Visual Studio}
4. Now run `exec loader.sce` in the scilab console. The toolbox will be ready
   to use.

   This toolbox consists of open-source solvers for a variety of optimization
problems: CLP for linear and quadratic optimization, CBC for integer linear
optimization, IPOPT (with MUMPS) for nonlinear optimization, and BONMIN for
integer nonlinear optimization.
