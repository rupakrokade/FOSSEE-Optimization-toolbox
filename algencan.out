 There are no fixed variables to be removed.

 The scaling feature was mainly developed for constrained problems. For
 unconstrained and bound-constrained problem, please, set the optimality
 tolerance (related to the sup-norm of the projected gradient of the
 objective function) with a convenient value. The scaling feature is being
 disabled.
